# asx_share_pricer
Still a work in progress. The main  part of the code puts a price on a company.
There are still some incomplete sections and mathemathical bugs.

The vision for the complete project is to have awebsite for friends and 
family to inspect shares they are considering to buy and perhaps to make suggestions
on good companies to invest in.
